# Feature selction

Using Feature selection methods in high dimensionality of feature space are vital. In machine learning, we can use feature selection techniques 
in order to select proper subset of feature to increase machine learning accuracy.
In this Repository we implemented various feature methods.

## Feature selection methods
  - Filter
  - Wrapper
  - Embeded
  - Hybrid#
## Feature Selection strategies:
  - Forward selection
  - Backward elimination
  - Forward stepwise selection
  - Backward stepwise elimination
  - Random mutation
